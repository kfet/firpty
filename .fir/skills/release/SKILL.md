# Release Skill

Release a new version of firpty.

## Version determination

If the user provides a version, use it. Otherwise, auto-determine:

1. Read the current version from `VERSION`.
2. Look at entries under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. If there are `### Added` or `### Removed` entries → **minor** bump (e.g. 0.1.0 → 0.2.0).
4. If there are only `### Fixed` or `### Changed` entries → **patch** bump (e.g. 0.1.0 → 0.1.1).
5. If the section is empty → ask the user whether to proceed or abort.

## Steps

1. **Full build & test** — execute `make all` and confirm everything passes (includes the 100% coverage gate).
2. **Check CHANGELOG** — read `CHANGELOG.md` and confirm there are entries under `## [Unreleased]`. If empty, ask the user.
3. **Determine version** — follow the rules above if the user didn't specify one. State the version and proceed.
4. **Update CHANGELOG** — rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date) and add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it. Keep reverse-chronological order.
5. **Update VERSION** — write the new version to the `VERSION` file (single trailing newline).
6. **Commit** — `git add -A` then `git commit -m "release: vVERSION"`. Check `git status` first to confirm contents.
7. **Tag** — `git tag -a vVERSION -m "release: vVERSION"` (pass `-m` to avoid opening an editor).
8. **Verify locally** — `make build` and run `./bin/firpty version` to confirm it prints the new version.

## Important notes

- **Uncommitted changes**: Always check `git status` before committing. All release-related and pending changes should be included in the release commit.
- **Avoid interactive git**: Always pass `-m` to `git tag -a` and `git commit`.
- **Moving tags**: If you need to move a tag after an additional commit, use `git tag -d vVERSION` then re-create it.

## Publishing

After the user confirms, run `make publish` to push the commit and tag to origin. GoReleaser CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) then builds cross-platform binaries (darwin/linux × amd64/arm64) and creates the GitHub Release.

If any step fails, stop and report the error. Do not push unless the user confirms.

## Post-publish: Track GitHub Actions

After `make publish` succeeds, poll GitHub Actions until every triggered workflow finishes:

```bash
gh run list --limit 10 --json status,conclusion,name,headSha,createdAt,databaseId 2>&1
```

Do **not** use `--branch` filtering — the tag-triggered `release` workflow doesn't appear under a branch filter. Match runs by `headSha` against the release commit.

Loop every 30 seconds. Stop when all runs for the release commit SHA are `completed`. If any conclude with `failure` or `cancelled`, report the failure:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed 2>&1 | tail -40
```

Do not ask the user whether to monitor — always do it automatically after a successful publish.
